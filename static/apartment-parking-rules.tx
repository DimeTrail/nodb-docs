Parking Lease Restriction for Tenants:

Each apartment unit is allocated one designated parking space. Only vehicles registered to the tenant of the respective apartment are allowed to park in the assigned space. Unauthorized vehicles may be subject to towing at the owner's expense.

Parking spaces are intended for the parking of standard passenger vehicles only. Commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, trailers, boats, or any other oversized vehicles are strictly prohibited from parking in designated spaces. Alternative parking arrangements must be made for such vehicles, subject to the approval of the property management.

Parking spaces are for the exclusive use of tenants and their authorized guests. Residents are responsible for informing their guests about the parking regulations and ensuring they park in designated visitor parking areas, if available. Parking in another tenant's assigned space without permission is strictly prohibited.

Vehicles must be parked within the designated parking space, ensuring they do not obstruct access to driveways, walkways, fire lanes, or impede the flow of traffic within the community. Parking on grassy areas, sidewalks, or any other non-designated areas is strictly prohibited.

Vehicles must be properly maintained and in good working condition. Any leaking fluids or vehicles deemed inoperable must be immediately removed from the premises. Failure to do so may result in fines and/or towing at the owner's expense.

The property management reserves the right to enforce additional parking rules and regulations as deemed necessary for the safety, convenience, and overall enjoyment of all residents. Violations of parking regulations may result in fines, towing, or other appropriate actions as outlined in the lease agreement.

By signing this parking lease restriction, tenants acknowledge their understanding and agreement to comply with the parking rules and regulations set forth above. Failure to adhere to these regulations may result in penalties, including fines and/or termination of the lease agreement.
